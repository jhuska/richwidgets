# RichWidgets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/richwidgets/richwidgets.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richwidgets/richwidgets) #

> A JavaScript project containing standalone javascript widgets based on Bootstrap, jQuery UI and other third-party widgets, styled with LESS.

## Users ##

Compiled files are avilable in the <code>[dist](https://github.com/richwidgets/richwidgets/tree/master/dist)</code> directory.
You can drop them in your project or directly.  Alternatively use the LESS and raw JavaScript files from the
<code>[src](https://github.com/richwidgets/richwidgets/tree/master/src)</code> directory.

## Build from source ##

Along with cloning the project you will need to install the following tools:

- Node and NPM: [instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager), [official website](https://npmjs.org/)
- Grunt: [instructions](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), [official website](http://gruntjs.com/)
- Bower: [instructions on official website](http://bower.io/)

Once installed, go to the project root and run the following commands:

- <code>npm install</code>
- <code>grunt bower</code>
- <code>grunt</code>

This should drop a bunch of logs in your shell and use up some bandwith. Once it's completed, you should have the
RichWidgets demo running on [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/) (provided you don't already have a process
running on that port!)
